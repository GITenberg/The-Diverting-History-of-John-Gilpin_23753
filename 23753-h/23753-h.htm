He soon replied, I do admire<br />

And you are she, my dearest dear,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Therefore it shall be done.</span></p>

I am a linendraper bold,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>As all the world doth know,</span><br />
And my good friend the calender<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Will lend his horse to go.</span></p>

<p>
Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, That's well said,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And for that wine is dear,</span><br />
We will be furnish'd with our own,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Which is both bright and clear.</span></p>

<p>
John Gilpin kiss'd his loving wife,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>O'erjoy'd was he to find,</span><br />
That, though on pleasure she was bent,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>She had a frugal mind.</span></p>

<p>
The morning came, the chaise was brought<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But yet was not allow'd</span><br />
To drive up to the door, lest all<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Should say that she was proud.</span></p>

<p>
So three doors off the chaise was stay'd,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Where they did all get in;</span><br />
Six precious souls, and all agog<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To dash through thick and thin.</span></p>

<p>
Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Were never folks so glad;</span><br />
The stones did rattle underneath,<br />

John Gilpin at his horse's side<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Seized last the flowing mane,</span><br />
And up he got in haste to ride,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But soon came down again;</span></p>

<p>
For saddle-tree scarce reach'd had he,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>His journey to begin,</span><br />
When, turning round his head, he saw<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Three customers come in.</span></p>

<p>
So down he came; for loss of time,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Although it grieved him sore,</span><br />
Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Would trouble him much more.</span></p>

<p>
'Twas long before the customers<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Were suited to their mind,</span><br />
When Betty, screaming, came down stairs,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>"The wine is left behind!"</span></p>

<p>
Good lack! quoth he, yet bring it me,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>My leathern belt likewise,</span><br />
In which I bear my trusty sword,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>When I do exercise.</span></p>

<p>
Now Mrs. Gilpin (careful soul!)<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Had two stone bottles found,</span><br />
To hold the liquor that she loved,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And keep it safe and sound.</span></p>

<p>
Each bottle had a curling ear,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Through which the belt he drew,</span><br />
And hung a bottle on each side,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To make his balance true.</span></p>

His long red cloak well brush'd and neat,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>He manfully did throw.</span></p>

<p>
Now see him mounted once again<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Upon his nimble steed,</span><br />
Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With caution and good heed.</span></p>

<p>
But finding soon another road<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Beneath his well-shod feet,</span><br />
The snorting boast began to trot,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Which gall'd him in his seat.</span></p>

<p>
So! fair and softly! John he cried,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But John he cried in vain;</span><br />
That trot became a gallop soon,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In spite of curb and rein.</span></p>

<p>
So stooping down, as needs he must<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Who cannot sit upright,</span><br />
He grasp'd the mane with both his hands,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And eke with all his might.</span></p>

<p>
His horse, who never in that sort<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Had handled been before,</span><br />
What thing upon his back had got<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Did wonder more and more.</span></p>

<p>
Away went Gilpin, neck or nought!<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Away went hat and wig;</span><br />
He little dreamt, when he set out,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of running such a rig.</span></p>

But still he seem'd to carry weight,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>With leathern girdle braced:</span><br />
For all might see the bottle necks<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Still dangling at his waist.</span></p>

<p>
Thus all through merry Islington<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>These gambols he did play,</span><br />
Until he came unto the Wash<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Of Edmonton so gay;</span></p>

<p>
And there he threw the wash about<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>On both sides of the way,</span><br />
Just like unto a trundling mop<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or a wild goose at play.</span></p>

<p>
At Edmonton his loving wife<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>From the balcony spied</span><br />
Her tender husband, wondering much<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>To see how he did ride.</span></p>

<p>
Stop, stop, John Gilpin!--Here's the house--<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>They all at once did cry;</span><br />
The dinner waits, and we are tired:<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Said Gilpin--So am I!</span></p>

<p>
But yet his horse was not a whit<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Inclined to tarry there;</span><br />
For why?--his owner had a house<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Full ten miles off, at Ware.</span></p>

<p>
So like an arrow swift he flew,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Shot by an archer strong;</span><br />
So did he fly--which brings me to<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>The middle of my song.</span></p>

Away went Gilpin out of breath,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And sore against his will,</span><br />
Till at his friend the calender's<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>His horse at last stood still.</span></p>

<p>
The calender, amazed to see<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>His neighbour in such trim,</span><br />
Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And thus accosted him:</span></p>

<p>
What news? what news? your tidings tell;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Tell me you must and shall--</span><br />
Say why bareheaded you are come,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Or why you come at all?</span></p>

<p>
Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And loved a timely joke;</span><br />
And thus unto the calender<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>In merry guise he spoke:</span></p>

<p>
I came because your horse would come;<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>And, if I well forebode,</span><br />
My hat and wig will soon be here,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>They are upon the road.</span></p>

<p>
The calender, right glad to find<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>His friend in merry pin,</span><br />
Return'd him not a single word,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>But to the house went in;</span></p>

<p>
Thence straight he came with hat and wig,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>A wig that flow'd behind,</span><br />
A hat not much the worse for wear,<br />
<span style='margin-left: 1em;'>Each comely in its kind.</span></p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
